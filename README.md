# React Todo List with Context API and Local Storage

This is a simple yet advanced Todo List application built with React. It showcases the use of modern React features and techniques including React Hooks, Context API, and local storage for persistence. The application is styled using Bootstrap, providing a clean and responsive user interface.

## Key Features

1. **Add Todo Tasks:** Users can add their tasks by entering the task in the input field and clicking the 'Add' button or pressing enter.

2. **View Todo Tasks:** All the tasks added by the user are listed in a neat table format. The table displays the task, its status, and actions that can be performed on it.

3. **Mark Tasks as Completed/Uncompleted:** Users can toggle the completion status of their tasks by clicking the 'Mark as Finished'/'Mark as Unfinished' button.

4. **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete any task by clicking on the 'Delete' button.

5. **Persistence:** The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage. This means that even if the user closes or refreshes the page, the tasks remain intact.

6. **Empty State:** When there are no tasks, the application displays a friendly message saying "No tasks Added".

7. **React Router:** The application uses React Router for navigation. There are two routes - one for adding tasks and the other for viewing the list of tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS:** This project is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks:** This project utilizes React Hooks (useState, useContext, useReducer) for managing state and context in a functional component.
- **React Context API:** Context API is used for state management, providing a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- **Local Storage:** Local Storage API is used to persist the tasks data in the browser even after page refreshes.
- **React Router:** React Router is used for handling navigation in the application.
- **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is used for styling the components in a responsive manner.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
